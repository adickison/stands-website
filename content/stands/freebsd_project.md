  FreeBSD is an open source operating system descended from the Unix developed
  at the University of California, Berkeley that became an open source project in
  1993 with several hundred active committers from across the globe. Today, FreeBSD
  provides a copy-free modern operating system that is up-to-date and scalable, offers
  high-performance, security, and advanced networking. It is used for personal workstations,
  Internet servers, embedded devices, routers, and firewalls. The FreeBSD packages
  collection includes popular software like: Apache web server, GNOME, KDE, X.org,
  Python, Firefox and over 33,000 software suites. The FreeBSD community is comprised
  of a global community of end users, developers and companies large and small working
  together to further the OS.

  <p>Since our last visit to FOSDEM, the FreeBSD Project has made strides
  in a number of areas including the soon to be available 13.0 release. First and foremost, the Project made the transition to git making it easier for
  folks to contribute. Great improvements were made in the graphics stack, as well
  as, to browser and video conferencing capabilities to allow for support on most
  any contemporary laptop. There is now better ARM64 support for servers and embedded
  devices like Raspberry Pi. The Project switched to a new OpenZFS upstream that supports
  FreeBSD and Linux. The removal of obsolete GPL components has been completed along
  with many network stack improvements. Finally, there is a lot of new online content
  to help folks get started and ask questions about FreeBSD including: <a href=https://wiki.freebsd.org/OfficeHours/”>FreeBSD Office
  Hours</a>, <a href=”https://freebsdfoundation.org/freebsd-fridays/”>FreeBSD Fridays</>, and several developers have hosted twitch live streaming
  sessions.</p><br/>
 <h3>What’s Ahead in 13.0</h3>
<p>Scheduled to release in late March, 13.0 is the culmination of two years of hard work and showcases a shift in focus towards the future of FreeBSD. From changes in architecture and the removal of legacy(obsolete?) tooling to faster systems and subsystems, the Project’s commitment towards looking at the future of FreeBSD is in motion! Check out the sidebar for more info on the 13.0 release</p>
 <h3>Get Involved</h3>
  <p>From submitting bug fixes to working on the documentation, there are a lot of ways to contribute to FreeBSD. The <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/freebsd-project/resources/">FreeBSD Resources Page</a> provides links to how-to guides, getting started videos, community blogs, and the above mentioned FreeBSD Office Hours and FreeBSD Fridays Series of Introductory talks. 
<h3>Support the Project through the FreeBSD Foundation</h3>
<p>The FreeBSD Foundation is a501(c)(3), US based, non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community. The purpose of the Foundation is to  sponsor software development work and fill gaps within the Project, support FreeBSD infrastructure, advocate for FreeBSD worldwide and serve as a legal entity for the Project. The Foundation is entirely supported by donations. If you’re a fan of FreeBSD please consider  <a href=”https://freebsdfoundation.org/donate/”>donating</a> today!</p>

  <p>Check out the <a href=”https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/bsd/”>BSD Devroom</a> on Sunday and visit the FreeBSD Stand to chat with FreeBSD Developers and other community members. The stand is a great place to learn more about the latest developments within the Project, find out how to get started with FreeBSD and get your most challenging questions answered. If you or your organization are looking to connect with other FreeBSD fans, folks in the stand can help. There’s a reason why companies like Netflix use FreeBSD. Take a minute to find out more about the stability and security of FreeBSD.</p>
