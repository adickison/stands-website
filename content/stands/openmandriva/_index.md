  OpenMandriva is a 100% community controlled Linux distribution.

  With (OMLx 4.2) Plasma 5.20.5, KDE Frameworks 5.78, Qt 5.12.2 and LibreOffice
   7.1, it is one of the most current distributions available.

  OpenMandriva was
   the first Linux distribution to switch to a clang based toolchain. In the current
   version, even the kernel is built with clang 11.

  While the primary focus of
   OpenMandriva is on the desktop, its repositories also contain a state of the art
   server stack.
showcase: |
  <p>OpenMandriva is aiming at being easy to get into for newbies, while being
    one of the most innovative distributions for developers. We were the first to
    switch to the clang toolchain, and are working on new interesting developer features
    for our 5.0 release.</p>
  <p>OpenMandriva can work on x86_64 systems as well as aarch64
    (not sharing some other distributions' limitation to UEFI compliant aarch64 server
    platforms), and can run as a desktop, workstation, server, or - since the advent
    of OpenMandriva on PinePhone - smartphone.</p>
  <p>You may want to pay us a visit if
    you are interested in getting into Linux or you are looking for a project that can
    use your help as a volunteer.</p>
  <p>OpenMandriva is not based on any other distribution.
    Contributors who are so inclined can do more than just submit a new theme or add
    an extra package.</p>

new_this_year: |
  <p>OpenMandriva has come a long way in porting to new hardware: In addition
    to the traditional x86_64 distribution and the extra version optimized specifically
    for AMD Ryzen processors, OpenMandriva now runs on Pinebook Pro, Cubox Pulse,
    various ARM devboards, and UEFI capable Aarch64 servers. A phone stack running
    on PinePhone is in the works (and ready for initial use). A RISC-V port is also
    in the works (presently running in qemu) and should be ready for daily use shortly
    after we can get our hands on Hifive Unmatched boards.</p>
  <p>With the 4.2 release
    done, our main focus has moved to 5.0 - which will bring many improvements to
    the core system, such as making crosscompiling and targeting multiple architectures
    easier than ever.
